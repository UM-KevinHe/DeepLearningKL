# DeepLearningKL
This project is to train deep learning survival model with prior information, where KL divergence is used for incorporating. The code is modified based on [pycox][1].
## Code Details
We have modified a small part of pycox for training deep learning model. So please make sure that the following steps are completed before running the [notebook][2].
1. Change `fdsf` in
